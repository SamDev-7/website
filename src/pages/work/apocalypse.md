I helped organize Apocalypse, a zombie-apocalypse themed coding event where 150 high-school students built their wildest ideas.  

It was 44 hours of coding, workshops, and crazy activities at Shopify's Toronto office. We had lots of hardware, a custom card game, a custom PCB badge, and most impressively, an economy that evolved into [something we did not expect](tooltip "In a good way").

This was a ambitious and unique event, and I'm so proud to be part of its creation.  

As of [writing](tooltip "June 2024"), Apocalypse is the **largest high-school hackathon in Canada**, running overnight for 44 hours from May 17, with 150 participants, [40 projects](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/ship) shipped, and [CA$48,000 in funding](https://hcb.hackclub.com/apocalypse) from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). Thank you to Hack Club, [Shopify](https://shopify.com), the organizing team, and our participants for making this event what it is.
