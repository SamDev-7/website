[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) has iron and gold nuggets, but where are the diamond nuggets?

Stemming from this silly idea, I created Diamond Nuggets, a simple Minecraft mod that adds diamond nuggets as a form of currency for multiplayer communities. This was an excuse to learn more about Java and Minecraft modding.

I built Diamond Nuggets for the two popular Minecraft modding toolchains, [Forge](https://minecraftforge.net/) and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). These exposed and added APIs to modify content in the game.

Gaining over **600,000 downloads**, I didn't expect Diamond Nuggets to be so popular. I hope to clean up the files and open-source it in the near future.
