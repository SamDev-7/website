          Hey! I'm Sam, a high-schooler in Ontario, Canada who is still figuring
          out what to do with the journey ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I taught myself how to code by building projects. From robots to
          games, the learning never ends.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I'm not busy with school work, you can find me tinkering with
          tech and exploring new hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been learning so much messing around with 3D printing &
          machining, graphic & UI design, the web, electronics & hardware,
          robotics, ML, and the list goes on... This website exists because I
          wanted to document my journey.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You may know me as a First Robotics kid, a Hack Clubber, a friend, or
          that random person at school.
        </p>
        <p>If we haven't met yet, I'd love to chat!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Welcome to this quiet corner amidst the chaotic world we're in where I
          share my thoughts and creations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bear in mind that this website is still a work in progress, but feel
          free to look around!
